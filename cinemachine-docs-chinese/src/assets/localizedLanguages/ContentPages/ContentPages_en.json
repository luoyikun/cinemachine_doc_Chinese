    "descriptionFirstParagraph": "Cinemachine is a suite of modules for controlling the Unity camera. Cinemachine solves the complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots. It is designed to significantly reduce the number of time-consuming manual manipulations and script revisions that take place during development.",
    "descriptionFirstParagraph.comment": "Cinemachine package's first paragraph description",
    "descriptionSecondParagraph": "The procedural nature of these modules makes Cinemachine robust and forgiving. When you make adjustments - for example, change an animation, vehicle speed, terrain, or other GameObjects in your Scene - Cinemachine dynamically adjusts its behavior to make the best shot. There is no need, for example, to re-write camera scripts just because a character turns left instead of right.",
    "descriptionSecondParagraph.comment": "Cinemachine package's second paragraph description",
    "descriptionThirdParagraph": "Cinemachine works in real time across all genres including FPS, third person, 2D, side-scroller, top down, and RTS. It supports as many shots in your Scene as you need. Its modular system lets you compose sophisticated behaviors.",
    "descriptionThirdParagraph.comment": "Cinemachine package's third paragraph description",
    "descriptionFourthParagraph": "Cinemachine works well with other Unity tools, acting as a powerful complement to Timeline, animation, and post-processing assets. Create your own extensions or integrate it with your custom camera scripts.",

    "upgradingParagraphOne": "Cinemachine 3.0 is a major version change from CM 2.X, and the API and data format have changed significantly. Scripts written for the CM 2.X API are unlikely to run with 3.X without manual intervention. Also, the CM Camera instances in your project will themselves need upgrading.",
    "upgradingParagraphOne.comment": "Upgrading paragraph one",
    "upgradingParagraphTwo": "While it is possible to upgrade an existing project from CM 2.X, you should think carefully about whether you are willing to put in the work. It might be better in many cases just to stick with CM 2.X, which will continue to be supported for a while in parallel with CM 3.X. If you do choose to upgrade your project, please see the upgrade guide.",
    "upgradingParagraphTwo.comment": "Upgrading paragraph two",
    "upgradingParagraphThree": "Cinemachine 3.0 maintains support - in deprecated form - of obsolete CM2 classes that have been superceded by newer ones. This is to help ease the transition to the new API. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade your project to use the new API as soon as possible. The deprecated classes will be removed in a future release. To reduce code bloat in your deliverables, the deprecated class support can be removed immediately by defining CINEMACHINE_NO_CM2_SUPPORT in your project's Scripting Define Symbols.",

      "1 Update the using Cinemachine declarations. The namespaces have been changed to Unity.Cinemachine.",
      "2 Update any references to the renamed components.",
      "3 Update the broken CM field names. For the most part, this just means removing the m_ prefix. In other cases, there might be a bit more to do, but the appropriate action to take should be clear by looking at the code in each case.",
      "4 At this point your project should more-or-less run as before, using the obsolete classes.",
      "The new CinemachineCamera class that replaces CinemachineVirtualCamera and CinemachineFreeLook inherits from CinemachineVirtualCameraBase. Where possible, replace your script references to use this base class rather than the derived type. If you do this, the CM upgrader tool will be able to preserve existing object references, since the old and new classes all inherit from this same base class.",
      "Upgrade the project data by running the Cinemachine Upgrader. You can launch the Cinemachine Upgrader tool from any CM VirtualCamera or FreeLook inspector.",
      "Because CM component types have changed, you will have to manually go through your scripts and update any specific references to be to the new type. The console log is your friend: \"obsolete\" warnings will point you to the places that need attention.",
      "After the data upgrade, object references might be broken. You will need to check and repair them if necessary.",
      "If you are using layers to filter cameras into separate split-screen brains, that filtering will stop working until after you have upgraded to CinemachineCameras and switched the filtering over to Channels."

For most of these issues, you will see errors or deprecation warnings in the console, which will point you to the areas in your code that need attention.",
    "WhatHasChangedInTheAPIParagraphTwo": "One thing to note: the new CinemachineCamera class that replaces CinemachineVirtualCamera and CinemachineFreeLook inherits from CinemachineVirtualCameraBase. If you can replace your script references to use this base class wherever possible, then existing object references will be preserved when the data is upgraded, since the old classes are also inherited from this same base class.",

Consequently, all of the \"m_\" prefixes have been removed from field names, everywhere. If your scripts don't compile because of this, the first remedy is to remove the \"m_\" from the field name that your script is referencing. Most of the time, that will be enough. Occasionally, some field names were changed more significantly. It should be fairly easy to find the appropriate replacements.",

    "CleanerObjectStructureNoHiddenGameObjectsTitle": "Cleaner Object Structure, No Hidden GameObjects",
    "CleanerObjectStructureNoHiddenGameObjectsParagraphOne": "Cinemachine 2.x implemented the CM pipeline on a hidden GameObject child of the vcam, named \"cm\". This has been removed in CM 3.0, and CM pipeline components (such as OrbitalFollow or RotationComposer) are now implemented directly as components on the CinemachineCamera GameObject. You can access them as you would any other components: GetCinemcachineComponent() is no longer necessary, just use GetComponent().",
    "CleanerObjectStructureNoHiddenGameObjectsParagraphTwo": "You will now see the cm child objects of your legacy CM vcams in the hierarchy, because CM3 unhides them. This is not a license to mess with these objects - they were hidden for a reason. We recommend that you get rid of them by upgrading the parent objects to their CM3 equivalents.",

    "NewInputHandlingTitle": "New Input Handling",
    "NewInputHandlingParagraphOne": "User input has been decoupled from the Cinemachine Components: they no longer directly read user input, but expect to be driven by an external component. CinemachineInputAxisController is provided to do this job, but you could also choose to implement your own input controller by inheriting InputAxisControllerBase.",

    "NewEventsArchitectureTitle": "New Events Architecture",
    "NewEventsArchitectureParagraphOne": "While CM2.X has events in CinemachineVirtualCamera and CinemachineBrain, CM3 only fires global events via CinemachineCore. Scripts can add listeners to those events and take action based on them. Listeners will receive events for all cameras and all Brains.",
    "NewEventsArchitectureParagraphTwo": "Camera-specific and Brain-specific events are now supported via two new behaviours: Cinemachine Brain Events and Cinemachine Camera Events. These monitor the global events and fire more specialized ones related to the objects to which they are attached.",

    "NewSplineImplementationTitle": "New Spline Implementation",
    "NewSplineImplementationParagraphOne": "Cinemachine's paths are now implemented using Unity's native Splines, which provide equivalent functionality. The Cinemachine Upgrader will automatically convert your CM paths to Splines. The CM path implementations still exist, but are now deprecated.",

    "DecoupledFromUnityLayersTitle": "Decoupled from Unity Layers",
    "DecoupledFromUnityLayersParagraphOne": "In CM2, CinemachineBrain would only process CinemachineCameras that were assigned to layers included in the associated Camera's culling mask. This mechanism was useful in situations such as split-screen, to cause specific CinemachineCameras to be assigned to specific Brains. In CM3, this has been replaced by Cinemachine Channels. These are dedicated layers that only Cinemachine uses, so that Unity layers don't get needlessly squandered. CinemachineCameras are assigned to a Cinemachine Channel, and the CinemachineBrain has a channel mask. Normally, the \"Default\" channel is used, and only needs to be changed in specific situations where channel separation is a requirement.",

    "LensModeOverrideTitle": "Lens Mode Override",
    "LensModeOverrideParagraphOne": "If your project is using virtual cameras with a Lens Mode Override (e.g. changing between physical and perspective and ortho cameras), then this will stop working until you enable mode override and assign a default lens mode in the CinemachineBrain.",

    "UpgradingTheProjectDataTitle": "Upgrading the Project Data",
    "UpgradingTheProjectDataParagraphOne": "Once the scripts are using the new API, you can upgrade the project data to convert legacy CM objects to their CM3 counterparts. Cinemachine comes with a data upgrade tool to facilitate this. It's not a trivial operation, because in addition to the vcam objects in your scene, it's also necessary to upgrade prefabs and animation assets that might be referencing them.",
    "UpgradingTheProjectDataParagraphTwo": "You can launch the Cinemachine Upgrader upgrade tool from any CM VirtualCamera or FreeLook inspector:",

    "UpgradingASingleObjectTitle": "Upgrading a Single Object",
    "UpgradingASingleObjectParagraphOne": "If you want to upgrade only the Cinemachine object currently being inspected, you can do this provided that it isn't a prefab instance. In this case, it will upgrade only the inspected objects, replacing them with CM3 equivalents. Undo is supported, so you can try it out and then change your mind if you want.",
    "UpgradingASingleObjectParagraphTwo": "Note that any script references to this object will be lost (because the class will change), as will any animation tracks that are writing to fields inside this camera (because classes and field names have changed). Timelines referencing this object will lose their bindings. If you have script references or animation tracks or if this camera is part of a prefab or prefab instance, then you need to use the \"Upgrade Entire Project\" option, which will scan the project for references and make the appropriate updates.",

    "UpgradingASingleSceneTitle": "Upgrading a Single Scene",
    "UpgradingASingleSceneParagraphOne": "You can also choose to update all the CM objects in the current scene. Again, this will not update any assets outside of the scene, so it is not appropriate for any but the simplest of scenes. Undo is also supported for this operation.",

    "UpgradingTheWholeProjectTitle": "Upgrading the Whole Project",
    "UpgradingTheWholeProjectParagraphOne": "The \"Upgrade Entire Project\" option will upgrade all the objects in all the scenes and all the prefabs. There is logic to handle animation tracks, script references, and prefab instances. It's a major operation and every scene and prefab in the project will be opened and saved multiple times. Undo is not supported, so be sure to make a complete backup first."
